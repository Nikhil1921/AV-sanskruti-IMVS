                            forward, and according to the criteria of our fixed amount, we have to provide
                            financial support to all of them. You have to deposit the amount directly
                            into the student's account.

                        <p class="desc text-justify font-size">
                            We have been involved in such social activities since 2004. With the launch of
                            the yearly scholarship program, our organization established a solid foundation
                            for youth empowerment through education with the launch of the yearly
                            scholarship program now. For the previous four years, we have worked hard in
                            India to grasp the actual situation of a currently existent scholarship program. We
                            have often thought that even talented students have to make numerous requests
                            and demonstrate that they are not financially capable of receiving a scholarship.
                            This approach can leave the child’s mind with a bad or even miserable feeling.
                            Scholarships mean that talented students must be supported, even if their
                            family's financial circumstances criteria are out of the question. We can give a bit
                            of additional scholarship money to any kid who is not financially capable so that
                            they can study better. A campaign worth over 1000 crore rupees is targeted for
                            the upcoming academic session of 2023-2024.

                            grace of Maa Saraswati to develop a beautiful personal life.
