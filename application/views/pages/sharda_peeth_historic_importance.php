                            describes both the spiritual and academic elements of Sharda Peeth. He describes Kashmir as
                            a patron of learning and Sharda Peeth as the source of that reputation. He also says that
                            the goddess Sharda: "resemble[s] a swan, carrying as her diadem the [glittering gold washed
                            from the sand] of the Madhumati stream, which is bent on rivalling Ganga. Spreading lustre

                            The mountain hosts three high-altitude lakes whose water is considered holy by Hindus. One
                            of them is Saraswati Lake. Others are Narda Lake — also known after Lakshmi the goddess of
                            wealth and fortune — and Nareel Lake. "The region is named after the Kashmiri name of Maa
                            Saraswati.

                            Sharda itself was like the Indus River Valley Civilization and other such civilizations
                            across the world.

                            "If Sharda Peeth Sthal is restored and conserved, it will attract millions of Hindus from
                            India and the rest of the world every year to worship & pray Maa Saraswati in the form of
                            Sharda.”
